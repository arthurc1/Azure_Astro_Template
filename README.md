# Astro & Azure Template with Tailwind CSS and Daisy UI

## Running
* `git clone...`
* `npm install`
* From /api/ directory make sure Functions are setup:
* `func start` - Then select dotnet (isolated worker model)
* Once the server is running succesfully, you can end the process
* `swa start`
* `http://localhost:4280/` - should see Astro welcome page, and Azure Function response test.

## Debugging Functions in C#
* From Run & Debug tab in VS.Code
* Run: `Attach to .NET Functions`
* `swa start --api-location http://localhost:7071`

## Deploying to Azure
* Ensure that both Azure Static Web Apps and Azure Functions extensions are installed in VS Code.
* In the Azure extension tab, go to Static Web Apps and click Create Static Web App.
* Choose a name and server location. For the app location, enter \. For the build location, enter \dist.
* This will create and push a .github\workflows\{app-name}.yml file, which triggers a GitHub Action to deploy your new static web app. You can find the deployed appâ€™s URL in the Azure dashboard or by expanding the app under Static Web Apps in the Azure extension in VS Code.
* The process will also automatically create a test Azure Function named HttpTrigger. You can confirm this by expanding the Functions node under your new Static Web App.
* Visit the deployed URL and verify:
    * You see the Astro demo page.
    * The Azure Function API call at the top of the page returns a successful response.
